# USC Course Watcher
USC Course Watcher is a google chrome extension developed by Decheol Jeong. This program constantly checks (evey minute) for a class availability from USC's web registration site and lets the user know if it finds at least one class with new opening. This program was created to help student like me to maximize their chances of getting into a full class. 

# How to install
You can download and install this extension here: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/usc-course-watcher/dpkcmpfeohfppbgflelbkemojphgjdhf?hl=en

# How to use
Watch you class easily by selecting the department name and providing the section number for the class.  If at least one of the classes you registered to USC Course Watcher is available, it will send you a notification instantly.

#Known Issues
The USC web registartion website (https://classes.usc.edu/) does not updates its opening as instantly as the USC web registration system. Because the USC course watcher performs web scraping from the website above, it won't be able to notify openings until the web registration site's data is updated.

The update for Fall 2015 will be done by May (after final exams of Spring 2015 semester).
